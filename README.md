# 📦 Holder Game (Deprecated)

## **🛑 Status**
This project is **deprecated** and will not receive further updates. It was created as a learning exercise and is not intended for production use.

## **🌟 Description**
Holder Game is an unfinished game concept centered around managing boxes. The player's goal is to grab boxes, store them in a drawer, and return them to their rightful owners when requested. Each box has an owner, and returning the wrong box results in losing a life.

To assist with organization, players can use an in-game notebook to jot down notes about where boxes are stored. The notebook has limited functionality, with three pages for drawing and erasing.

## **✨ Features**
- **Grab and drop boxes:** Store boxes in any position within the drawer.
